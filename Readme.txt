The app shows, the budget available, the expenses and the revenue. 
It also has a dashboard where the employee can add a new entry (an revenue or an expense), and can toggle between the revenue list (that show only all revenue entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the expense entries)
and All list that shows combined entries for Revenue and Expense. 

The employee can edit or delete an entry. The app has a visual chart, so the employee can easily compare the expenses vs revenue generated.

Employee's revenue and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, or reboot his machine, he can always find his data there.
